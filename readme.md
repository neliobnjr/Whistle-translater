    <p style="font-size: 18px;">This project is a fun experiment that allows you to play music with your mouth whistle through an Arduino buzzer. The project is composed of two main parts: a Python script that listens to your laptop's microphone and detects the frequency of the whistle, and an Arduino sketch that receives the frequency and plays the corresponding tone on the buzzer.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 28px;">Getting Started</h2>

    <p style="font-size: 18px;">To get started, you'll need an Arduino starter kit, a microphone, and a computer running Python 3. You'll also need to install a few Python libraries:</p>

    <ul style="font-size: 18px;">
        <li>numpy</li>
        <li>matplotlib</li>
        <li>pyaudio</li>
        <li>serial</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="font-size: 18px;">Once you have the required hardware and software, you can connect the buzzer to the Arduino and upload the provided sketch. Then, run the Python script and start whistling!</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 28px;">Contributing</h2>

    <p style="font-size: 18px;">If you'd like to contribute to this project, feel free to open a pull request or submit an issue. We welcome contributions of all kinds, including bug reports, feature requests, documentation improvements, and code contributions.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 18px;">Happy whistling!</p>
